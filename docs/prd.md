# Brew & Bean Coffee Co. Customer Experience POC Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Demonstrate digital ordering capability to reduce customer wait times from 8 minutes to under 3 minutes
- Validate user acceptance of web-based ordering interface through intuitive customer experience
- Prove staff operational efficiency with digital order management dashboard
- Establish technical feasibility of Angular-based solution for future full-scale development
- Secure stakeholder approval for proceeding to full digital transformation implementation

### Background Context
Brew & Bean Coffee Co. faces a critical customer experience challenge with 8-minute average wait times during peak hours, causing 67% of customers to express dissatisfaction. The current manual ordering process creates bottlenecks that impact both customer retention and operational efficiency. This POC will demonstrate how a simple Angular web application can streamline the ordering workflow, providing a foundation for the company's broader digital transformation strategy while focusing specifically on the core pain point of wait time reduction.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, intuitive coffee ordering experience that feels familiar to users of popular food delivery apps, prioritizing speed and simplicity over feature richness. The interface should guide users through a logical flow from menu browsing to order confirmation in under 60 seconds, while providing staff with a clear, actionable dashboard for order management.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Single-page flow:** Minimize navigation complexity with smooth transitions between ordering steps
- **Visual product selection:** Image-driven menu display with clear pricing and customization options
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show customization options only when relevant to avoid overwhelming users
- **One-click actions:** Staff dashboard emphasizes single-click status updates and order management
- **Real-time feedback:** Immediate visual confirmation for all user actions and selections

### Core Screens and Views
- **Customer Menu Screen:** Grid/list view of coffee offerings with filtering and search capability
- **Order Builder Screen:** Customization interface with real-time pricing and add-to-cart functionality
- **Order Confirmation Screen:** Summary and final confirmation with estimated ready time
- **Staff Dashboard:** Live order queue with status management and order details
- **Order Detail Modal:** Expandable view for full order specifications and special instructions

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratios, and appropriate ARIA labels for all interactive elements.

### Branding
Clean, modern coffee shop aesthetic with warm earth tones reflecting Brew & Bean's artisanal coffee focus. Minimal, uncluttered design emphasizing product imagery and clear typography for quick scanning during busy periods.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop and tablet use in coffee shop environment, with mobile-friendly responsive design for potential customer mobile access during POC demonstration.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the Angular application with clear separation between customer and staff interfaces through Angular modules and routing.

### Service Architecture
**Single Page Application (SPA):** Monolithic Angular application with component-based architecture, service layer for state management, and local storage for data persistence. No backend services required for POC - all functionality self-contained within the web application.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration:** Comprehensive unit testing for components and services using Jasmine/Karma (Angular defaults), plus integration testing for user workflows and component interactions. Manual testing convenience methods for staff workflow validation and order processing scenarios.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:**
- **Angular (Latest Stable):** Chosen for component modularity, TypeScript integration, and enterprise-grade structure suitable for future expansion
- **Angular Material:** UI component library for consistent, accessible interface elements and responsive design patterns
- **TypeScript:** Full type safety implementation for maintainable, scalable code

**State Management:**
- **Angular Services:** Centralized data management using Angular's built-in dependency injection
- **RxJS:** Reactive programming for handling asynchronous operations and state changes
- **Local Storage API:** Browser-based persistence for order data and application state

**Development Tooling:**
- **Angular CLI:** Project scaffolding, development server, and build optimization
- **ESLint + Prettier:** Code quality and consistent formatting
- **Chrome DevTools:** Primary debugging and performance analysis tool

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Static Web Hosting:** Build artifacts deployable to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- **Development Server:** Angular CLI dev server for local development and stakeholder demonstrations
- **Build Optimization:** Production builds with minification and tree-shaking for performance

**Browser Support:**
- **Modern Browsers Only:** Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **No IE Support:** Focus on modern web standards and APIs
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Graceful degradation for older browser versions
