# Project Brief: Brew & Bean Coffee Co. Customer Experience POC

## Executive Summary

**Project:** Customer Experience Proof of Concept - Wait Time Reduction Initiative
**Stakeholder:** Maria Rodriguez, Founder & Owner
**Focus:** Single challenge solution targeting operational efficiency

**Primary Objective:** Create a simple Angular web application POC to demonstrate how digital ordering can reduce customer wait times from 8 minutes to under 3 minutes.

**Value Proposition:** Prove the concept of digital ordering through a basic web interface that shows potential for wait time reduction without complex integrations or security considerations.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
**Primary Challenge:** Long customer wait times affecting customer satisfaction

- **Service Issues:** 8-minute average wait times during peak hours (67% of customers complain)
- **Customer Impact:** Customers frustrated with unpredictable service timing
- **Immediate Need:** Demonstrate how digital ordering could reduce wait times to <3 minutes

### POC Objective
**Prove the concept** that a simple digital ordering interface can streamline the ordering process and reduce wait times without requiring complex backend integrations or security implementations.

## Proposed Solution

### POC Approach
Create a **simple Angular web application** that demonstrates digital ordering capabilities:

1. **Customer Ordering Interface:** Basic web app for placing coffee orders
2. **Staff Dashboard:** Simple view for managing incoming orders
3. **Order Flow Simulation:** Mock the ordering and fulfillment process

### Key POC Features
- **Simple UI:** Clean, intuitive ordering interface
- **No Authentication:** Focus on core ordering flow without security complexity
- **Mock Data:** Use static menu data and simulated order processing
- **Basic Workflow:** Demonstrate order placement, queue management, and completion

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Professional Coffee Commuters
**Representative Persona:** Sarah Chen, 28, Marketing Professional

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-35, urban professionals
- Income: $50,000-$80,000 annually
- Technology: High smartphone usage, app-native behaviors

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Frequency: 3-5 coffee purchases per week
- Timing: Pre-work rush (7-9 AM), afternoon energy boost (2-4 PM)
- Decision Drivers: Speed, consistency, quality, convenience

**Current Pain Points:**
- 10+ minute wait times during peak hours
- Missed loyalty point accumulation
- Limited payment flexibility
- Unpredictable service timing

**Goals & Needs:**
- Skip lines through mobile pre-ordering
- Effortless rewards earning and redemption
- Discover seasonal offerings
- Reliable timing for meeting schedules

**Quote:** *"I love Brew & Bean's coffee, but I can't afford to be late to meetings"*


## Goals & Success Metrics

### POC Objectives
1. **Primary Goal:** Demonstrate potential for wait time reduction from 8 minutes to <3 minutes
2. **User Experience:** Show intuitive ordering process that customers can complete quickly
3. **Workflow Validation:** Prove digital orders can be efficiently managed by staff

### POC Success Criteria
- **Interface Usability:** Users can complete an order in under 60 seconds
- **Order Processing:** Staff can view and manage orders through simple dashboard
- **Concept Validation:** Stakeholder approval to proceed with full development
- **Technical Feasibility:** Angular application demonstrates core ordering functionality

## POC Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
**Customer Interface (Angular Web App):**
- Menu display with coffee options
- Simple order builder (drink selection, size, customizations)
- Order summary and submission
- Basic order confirmation

**Staff Dashboard:**
- View incoming orders
- Mark orders as in-progress/completed
- Simple order queue management

### Out of Scope for POC
- User authentication or accounts
- Payment processing
- Real-time notifications
- Database persistence (use local storage/mock data)
- Mobile app (web-only)
- Integration with existing systems
- Security implementations
- Loyalty programs

### POC Success Criteria
- Functional ordering interface
- Working staff dashboard
- Demonstrates potential 5-minute reduction in ordering/fulfillment process
- Stakeholder approval for concept

## Post-POC Vision

### Next Phase (If POC Approved)
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Implement real payment processing
- Develop mobile applications
- Add real-time order notifications
- Integrate with POS systems

### Long-term Vision
If the POC successfully demonstrates wait time reduction potential, proceed with full-scale digital transformation including operational systems and multi-location deployment.

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular (latest stable version)
- **Styling:** Angular Material or Bootstrap for clean UI
- **State Management:** Angular services with local storage
- **Data:** Mock/static data (no backend required)

### Architecture Approach
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** with routing for customer and staff views
- **Component-based structure** for reusable UI elements
- **Service layer** for data management and order processing simulation
- **Local storage** for temporary order persistence

### Development Requirements
- No authentication system
- No payment integration
- No external APIs or databases
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use

## Constraints & Assumptions

### POC Constraints
- **Timeline:** Rapid development for concept validation
- **Scope:** Limited to core ordering functionality only
- **Resources:** Single developer, minimal complexity
- **Environment:** Development/demo environment only

### Key Assumptions
- Stakeholders can evaluate concept effectiveness through simulation
- Basic web interface sufficient for initial validation
- Mock data adequately represents real ordering scenarios
- Angular technology acceptable for future development

## Risks & Open Questions

### POC Risks
- **Concept Validation:** Mock environment may not accurately represent real-world challenges
- **User Acceptance:** Staff comfort with digital interface
- **Technical Feasibility:** Angular performance on various devices

### Open Questions
- Preferred device types for staff dashboard (tablet, desktop, etc.)
- Menu complexity and customization requirements
- Order volume estimation for interface design
- Staff workflow preferences for order management

### Areas for POC Testing
- User interface intuitiveness
- Order processing workflow efficiency
- Device compatibility and responsiveness

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Angular Setup:** Initialize Angular project with basic routing
2. **UI Design:** Create mockups for customer ordering and staff dashboard
3. **Component Development:** Build core ordering interface components
4. **Demo Preparation:** Prepare demonstration scenarios for stakeholder review

### Development Deliverables
- **Customer Ordering Interface:** Menu display, order builder, confirmation
- **Staff Dashboard:** Order queue, status management
- **Demo Script:** Guided walkthrough showing wait time reduction potential
- **Technical Documentation:** Basic setup and deployment instructions

**POC Success:** Demonstrate clear potential for wait time reduction through digital ordering to gain approval for full development phase.**
